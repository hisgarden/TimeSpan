# TimeSpan 'ts' Command Integration Test

This file demonstrates the new `ts` command integration with Warp.

## Usage Examples:

```bash
# For client work
ts work done on client CSAR authentication

# For general work  
ts implemented new feature for user dashboard

# For bug fixes
ts fixed critical security vulnerability in auth module
```

The `ts` command will:
1. Add all changes to git
2. Commit with your message
3. Auto-detect project from directory path
4. Estimate time based on changes
5. Track time in TimeSpan automatically
